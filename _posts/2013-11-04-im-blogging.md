Welcome to my Blog :)

# A little about me

Name: James Stone  
Age: 17  
Job: Student  
Location: Australia

&nbsp;

I wasn&#8217;t really sure what my first post, *my intro post*, should talk about. So I have decided to mention why I&#8217;m blogging.

I have decided to start blogging for a few reasons but I guess the main reason is my online presence.

# Online Presence

Growing up the number of times I have heard the media, school, speakers etc talk about our *online image*. Particularly about stories where people have lost jobs or failed to get them over their poor digital image. And like most kids my age I&#8217;m sick of hearing their message about why we shouldn&#8217;t post anything stupid online as it stays &#8220;*forever&#8221;*. I disagree with this message. I think they should instead be teaching us how to market ourselves online, to create the best possible digital image.

I think their message is scaring us from contributing to the public web (at least its scaring me!). However I also think that rather than not posting anything online and having a neutral online presence it&#8217;s important to have a positive one. So I have decided to take their advice one step further. Rather than not being stupid online, I will try and standout by having a strong positive online presence, that can be used to market myself.

# Future Job?

Another key reason why I&#8217;m going to blog is for a future job.

At the moment I&#8217;m not really sure what job I would like to have. However, I&#8217;m leaning towards a career in IT likely one that involves web development. As such I&#8217;ve noticed many blogs and portfolio sites of those in the industry where they display all their works. So I&#8217;m also planning on using this as a blog as a place to showcase my creations.

# Credit where its due

As this is the opening post on this blog, I think it&#8217;s important to give credit to the blogs current design. The theme, [Decode][1], is created by [Scott Smith][2]. However, I&#8217;m keen to create my own theme – *I just haven&#8217;t had the chance yet *

I hope you enjoy reading this blog as much as I have so far enjoyed creating it

Finally, if you have any questions, suggestions etc please leave a comment or [contact][3] me [here][3]
